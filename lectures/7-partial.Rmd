## Today

- path diagrams
- partial and semi-partial correlations

## Causal relationships

Does parent socioeconomic status *cause* better grades?

  * $r_{GPA,SES} = .33, b = .41$
  
--

Potential confound: Peer relationships

   - $r_{SES, peer} = .29$
   - $r_{GPA, peer} = .37$

???

Don't know how variables are related, only know that they are

in a perfect world, we would want to **hold constant** peer relationships
- control for
- partial out
