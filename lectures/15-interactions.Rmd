## Today

Mixing categorical and continuous predictors

Two categorical predictors

Start discussing Factorial ANOVA 

---

Consider the case where D is a variable representing two groups. In a univariate regression, how do we interpret the coefficient for D?

$$\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}D$$

--

$b_0$ is the mean of the reference group, and D represents the difference in means between the two groups.

---

Extending this to the multivariate case, where X is continuous and D is a dummy code representing two groups.

$$\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}D + b_2X$$

How do we interpret $b_1?$

--

$b_1$ is the difference in means between the two groups *if the two groups have the same average level of X* or holding X constant. 

This, by the way, is ANCOVA.

---

```{r, echo = F, message=F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(022520)
D = rep(c(0,1), each = 10)
X = rnorm(20) + D
Y = 2*D + X + rnorm(20)

df = data.frame(X,Y,D)

means = df %>%
  group_by(D) %>%
  summarize(M = mean(Y))

predict.1 = cbind(predict.1[1,], predict.1[2,])

We might be interested in the relative contributions of our two variables, but we have to remember that they're on different scales, so we cannot compare them using the unstandardized regression coefficient.

Standardized coefficients can be used if we only have two groups, but what if we have 3 or more?

--

Just like we use $R^2$ to report how much variance in Y is explained by the model, we can break this down into the unique contributions of each variable in the model, including factors with 3+ levels. 

$$\large \eta^2 = \frac{SS_{\text{Variable}}}{SS_{Y}}== \frac{SS_{\text{Variable}}}{SS_{\text{Total}}}$$

---

```{r}
mod = lm(Y ~ X + D, data = df)
anova(mod)
```

$$\large \eta^2_{X} = \frac{64.045}{64.045+20.071+17.707} = .62899 = 63\%$$
$$\large \eta^2_{D} = \frac{20.071}{64.045+20.071+17.707} = .19712 = 20\%$$

---

Now extend this example to include joint effects, not just additive effects:

$$\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}D + b_2X + b_3DX$$

How do we interpret $b_1?$

--

$b_1$ is the difference in means between the two groups *when X is 0*.

What is the intrepretation of $b_2$?

--

$b_2$ is the slope of X among the reference group.

What is the interpretation of $b_3?$

--

$b_3$ is the difference in slopes between the reference group and the other group.

---

```{r, echo = F}
ggplot(df, aes(X,Y, color = as.factor(D))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)+
  labs(color = "D") +
  cowplot::theme_cowplot()

```

Where should we draw the segment to compare means?

???

Where you draw the segment changes the difference in means. That's why $b_1$ can only be interpreted as the difference in means when X = 0.

A recent study by [Craig, Nelson, & Dixson, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619834876) examined whether the presence or absence of a beard made it easier to decode a man's facial expression. In this study, participants were presented with photographs of bearded and clean-shaven men making expressive faces.

.pull-left[
![](images/beard photos.png)
]

.pull-right[
Participants were asked to categorize each face as "happy" or "angry" as quickly as possible. Reaction time (in ms) was the outcome. I want to know whether men who are good at identifying expressions of clean-shaven men are also good at identifying bearded men; I also want to know if that relationship differs among men (participants) who are bearded.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(here)
beards = read.csv(here("data/beards.csv"), stringsAsFactors = F)
```

```{r, echo = F}
beards = beards %>% 
  filter(beard %in% c("No","Yes")) %>%
  mutate(beard = factor(beard, levels = c("No", "Yes")))
```

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(psych)
table(beards$beard)
describe(beards[,c("BA_mean", "CA_mean")], fast = T)

```{r}
beard.mod = lm(BA_mean ~ CA_mean*beard, data = beards)
summary(beard.mod)
```

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

plot_model(beard.mod, type = "int", show.data = T, axis.title = c("Response to clean-shaven faces (in miliseconds)", "Response to bearded faces (in miliseconds)"), legend.title = "Participant beard?", title = "Smaller difference in reaction to clean-shaven and bearded faces among clean-shaven participants", wrap.title = T)
```

## Two categorical predictors

If both X and M are categorical variables, the interpretation of coefficients is no longer the value of means and slopes, but means and differences in means. 

Recall our Solomon's paradox example from a few weeks ago:

```{r}
solomon = read.csv(here("data/solomon.csv"))
```
```{r, echo = F}
solomon$PERSPECTIVE = ifelse(solomon$CONDITION %in% c(1,2), "self", "other")
solomon$DISTANCE = ifelse(solomon$CONDITION %in% c(1,3), "immersed", "distanced")
```
```{r}
head(solomon[,c("PERSPECTIVE", "DISTANCE", "WISDOM")])
```
---

```{r, highlight.output = 11}
solomon.mod = lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon)
summary(solomon.mod)
```

---

```{r, highlight.output = 12}
solomon.mod = lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon)
summary(solomon.mod)
```

---

```{r, highlight.output = 13}
solomon.mod = lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon)
summary(solomon.mod)
```

---

```{r, highlight.output = 14}
solomon.mod = lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon)
summary(solomon.mod)
```

---

```{r, highlight.output = 21}
solomon.mod = lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon)
summary(solomon.mod)
```

---
```{r}
plot_model(solomon.mod, type = "int")
```

The interaction of two or more categorical variables in a general linear model is formally known as **Factorial ANOVA**.

A factorial design is used when there is an interest in how two or more variables (or factors) affect the outcome. 

* Rather than conduct separate one-way ANOVAs for each factor, they are all included in one analysis. 

* The unique and important advantage to a factorial ANOVA over separate one-way ANOVAs is the ability to examine interactions.

The example data are from a simulated study in which 180 participants performed an eye-hand coordination task in which they were required to keep a mouse pointer on a red dot that moved in a circular motion.  
]
.pull-right[
![](images/dot.jpg)
]

The outcome was the time of the 10th failure. The experiment used a completely crossed, 3 x 3 factorial design. One factor was dot speed: .5, 1, or 1.5 revolutions per second.  The second factor was noise condition.  Some participants performed the task without any noise; others were subjected to periodic and unpredictable 3-second bursts of 85 dB white noise played over earphones.  Of those subjected to noise, half could do nothing to stop the noise (uncontrollable noise); half believed they could stop the noise by pressing a button (controllable noise).

---

In a **completely crossed** factorial design, each level of one factor occurs in combination with each level of the other factor.

If equal numbers of participants occur in each combination, the design is **balanced**.  This has some distinct advantages (described later). 

| | Slow | Medium | Fast |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise | X | X | X |
| Controllable Noise | X | X | X |
| Uncontrollable Noise | X | X | X |

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
mean.summary = Data %>%
  group_by(Noise, Speed) %>%
  summarize(Time = mean(Time)) %>%
  spread("Speed", "Time")
mean.summary$Noise = as.character(mean.summary$Noise)
mean.summary$Marginal = rowMeans(mean.summary[2:4])
mean.summary[4,1] = "Marginal"
mean.summary[4,2:5] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% kable_styling() %>% group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3)
```


There are three important ways we can view the results of this experiment.  Two of them correspond to questions that would arise in a simple one-way ANOVA:

Regardless of noise condition, does speed of the moving dot affect performance?

Regardless of dot speed, does noise condition affect performance?

---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>%
  row_spec(4, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#562457")
```

We can answer those questions by examining the marginal means, which isolate one factor while collapsing across the other factor.

Regardless of noise condition, does speed of the moving dot affect performance?  Faster moving dots are harder to track and lead to faster average failure times.

Adding information about variability allows us a sense of whether these are significant and meaningful differences...

---

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4.5}
library(ggpubr)
ggbarplot(data = Data, x = "Speed", y = "Time", add = c("mean_ci"), fill = "#562457", xlab = "Speed Condition", ylab = "Mean Seconds (95% CI)", title = "Failure time as a function of\nspeed condition") + cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = 20)
```

Looks like the mean differences are substantial.  The ANOVA will be able to tell us if the means are significantly different  and the magnitude of those differences in terms of variance accounted for.

---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>% 
  column_spec(5, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#562457")
```

Regardless of dot speed, does noise condition affect performance?  Performance declines in the presence of noise, especially if the noise is uncontrollable.

Here, too adding information about variability allows us a sense of whether these are significant and meaningful differences...

---

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4.5}
ggbarplot(data = Data, x = "Noise", y = "Time", add = c("mean_ci"), fill = "#562457", xlab = "Noise Condition", ylab = "Mean Seconds (95% CI)", title = "Failure time as a function of\nnoise condition") + cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = 20)
```

The mean differences are not as apparent for this factor. The ANOVA will be particularly important for informing us about statistical significance and effect size.

---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) 
```
The **marginal mean differences** correspond to main effects. They tell us what impact a particular factor has, ignoring the impact of the other factor. 

The remaining effect in a factorial design, and it primary advantage over separate one-way ANOVAs, is the ability to examine **conditional mean differences**.

  column_spec(4, background = "#FFFFC5") %>%
  column_spec(5, background = "grey", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "white")
```

Are the marginal mean differences for noise condition a good representation of what is happening within each of the dot speed conditions?

If not, then we would need to say that the noise condition effect depends upon (is conditional on) dot speed.  We would have an interaction between noise condition and dot speed condition.

---

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4.5}
ggbarplot(data = Data, x = "Noise", y = "Time", fill = "Speed", add = c("mean_ci"), position = position_dodge(), xlab = "Noise Condition", ylab = "Mean Seconds (95% CI)", title = "Failure time as a function of\nnoise condition and speed condition") + cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = 20)
```

The noise condition means are most distinctly different in the medium speed condition. The noise condition means are clearly not different in the fast speed condition. 

---

The presence of an interaction qualifies any main effect conclusions, leading to "yes, but" or "it depends" kinds of inferences.

.pull-left[

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,echo =F}

```

.pull-right[

Does noise condition affect failure time? 
]
--
.pull-right[
"Yes, but the magnitude of the effect is strongest for the medium speed condition, weaker for the fast speed condition, and mostly absent for the slow speed condition."

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%

Interactions are symmetrical.

Are the marginal mean differences for speed condition a good representation of what is happening within each of the noise conditions?

If not, then we would need to say that the speed condition effect depends upon (is conditional on) noise condition.

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ |

The two main effects and the interaction represent three independent questions we can ask about the data. We have three null hypotheses to test.

One null hypothesis refers to the marginal row means.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\large H_0&: \mu_{1.} = \mu_{2.} = \dots = \mu_{R.}\\
H_1&: \text{Not true that }\mu_{1.} = \mu_{2.} = \dots = \mu_{R.}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ |

We can state this differently (it will make stating the interaction null hypothesis easier when we get to it).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\large \alpha_r&= \mu_{r.} - \mu_{..} \\
\large H_0&: \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \dots = \alpha_R = 0\\
H_1&: \text{At least one }\alpha_r \neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

---

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |

| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ |

The main effect for dot speed (column marginal means) can be stated similarly:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\large \beta_c&= \mu_{.c} - \mu_{..} \\
\large H_0&: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \dots = \beta_C = 0\\
H_1&: \text{At least one }\beta_c \neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

---

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ |

The interaction null hypothesis can then be stated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\large (\alpha\beta)_{rc}&= \mu_{rc} - \alpha_r - \beta_c  - \mu_{..} \\
\large H_0&: (\alpha\beta)_{11} = (\alpha\beta)_{12} = \dots = (\alpha\beta)_{RC} = 0\\
H_1&: \text{At least one }(\alpha\beta)_{rc} \neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
---

As was true for the simpler one-way ANOVA, we will partition the total variability in the data matrix into two basic parts. 

One part will represent variability **within groups**.  This within-group variability is variability that has nothing to do with the experimental conditions (all participants within a particular group experience the same experimental conditions). 

The other part will be **between-group variability**.  This part will include variability due to experimental conditions.  We will further partition this between-group variability into parts due to the two main effects and the interaction.

---

$$
\begin{aligned}
\large SS_{\text{total}} &= \sum_{r=1}^R\sum_{c=1}^C\sum_{i=1}^{N_{rc}}(Y_{rci}-\bar{Y}_{rc.})^2 \\
\large SS_R &= CN\sum_{r=1}^R(\bar{Y}_{r..}-\bar{Y}_{...})^2\\
SS_C &= RN\sum_{c=1}^C(\bar{Y}_{.c.}-\bar{Y}_{...})^2\\
\large SS_{RC} &= \sum_{r=1}^R\sum_{c=1}^C\sum_{i=1}^{N_{rc}}(\bar{Y}_{rc.}-\bar{Y}_{r..}-\bar{Y}_{.c.}+\bar{Y}_{...})^2 \\
\large SS_{RC} &= N\sum_{r=1}^R\sum_{c=1}^C(\bar{Y}_{rc.}-\bar{Y}_{r..}-\bar{Y}_{.c.}+\bar{Y}_{...})^2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

If the design is balanced (equal cases in all conditions), then:

$$\large SS_{\text{total}} = SS_{\text{within}} + SS_R + SS_C + SS_{RxC}$$

$df$, $MS$, and $F$ ratios are defined in the same way as they were for one-way ANOVA. We just have more of them.

Each mean square is a variance estimate.  $MS_{within}$  is the pooled estimate of the within-groups variance.  It represents only random or residual variation.  $MS_R$, $MS_C$, and $MS_{RxC}$ also contain random variation, but include systematic variability too.

If the null hypotheses are true, these ratios will be approximately 1.00 because the numerator and denominator of each estimate the same thing. Departures from 1.00 indicate that systematic variability is present. If large enough, we reject the null hypothesis (each considered separately).

The degrees of freedom for the different F ratios might not be the same. Different degrees of freedom define different theoretical F density distributions for determining what is an unusual value under the null hypothesis.


Which is to say, you might get the same F-ratio for two different tests, but they could have different p-values, if they represent different numbers of groups.

```{r}
fit = lm(Time ~ Speed*Noise, data = Data)
anova(fit)
```

Interpretation?

--
All three null hypotheses are rejected.  This only tells us that systemic differences among the means are present; follow-up comparisons are necessary to determine the nature of the differences. 
---

```{r}
fit = lm(Time ~ Speed*Noise, data = Data)
anova(fit)
```

Both main effects and the interaction are significant.

The significant interaction qualifies the main effects:

- The magnitude of the speed main effect varies across the noise conditions.

- The magnitude of the noise main effect varies across the speed conditions.

---

All of the effects in the ANOVA are statistically significant, but how big are they?  The effect size, h2, provides a simple way of indexing effect magnitude for ANOVA designs, especially as they get more complex.

$$\large \eta^2 = \frac{SS_{\text{effect}}}{SS_{\text{total}}}$$
If the design is balanced...

$$\large SS_{\text{total}} = SS_{\text{speed}} + SS_{\text{noise}}+SS_{\text{speed:noise}}+SS_{\text{residual}}$$
---


```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '') # print NA's as blank

eta.tab = as.data.frame(lsr::etaSquared(fit))
aov.fit = anova(fit)
eta.tab$source = rownames(eta.tab)
eta.tab[4, "source"] = "Residuals"
eta.tab$SS = aov.fit$`Sum Sq`
eta.tab[5, "source"] = "Total"
eta.tab[5, "SS"] = sum(eta.tab$SS)
eta.tab[,c("source", "SS", "eta.sq", "eta.sq.part")] %>%
  kable(., digits = 2,  format = "html",
        col.names = c("Source", "SS", "$\\eta^2$", '$\\text{partial }\\eta^2$'), 
         row.names = F, escape = F) %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "10em")
```

The Speed main effect accounts for 8 to 9 times as much variance in the outcome as the Noise main effect and the Speed x Noise interaction.

### $\eta^2$

.pull-left[
**If the design is balanced:**

There is no overlap among the independent variables. They are uncorrelated.

The variance accounted for by any effect is unique. There is no ambiguity about the source of variance accounted for in the outcome.

The sum of the $\eta^2$ for effects and residual is 1.00.

### $\eta^2$

One argument against $\eta^2$ is that its magnitude depends in part on the magnitude of the other effects in the design. If the amount of variability due to Noise or Speed x Noise changes, so to does the effect size for Speed.

$$\large \eta^2_{speed} = \frac{SS_{\text{speed}}}{SS_{\text{speed}} + SS_{\text{noise}} + SS_{\text{speed:noise}}+ SS_{\text{residual}}}$$

An alternative is to pretend the other effects do not exist and reference the effect sum of squares to residual variability.

$$\large \text{partial }\eta^2_{speed} = \frac{SS_{\text{speed}}}{SS_{\text{speed}} + SS_{\text{residual}}}$$
---

### $\eta^2$

One rationale for partial $\eta^2$ is that the residual variability represents the expected variability in the absence of any treatments or manipulations.  The presence of any treatments or manipulations only adds to total variability.  Viewed from that perspective, residual variability is a sensible benchmark against which to judge any effect.

$$\large \text{partial }\eta^2_{effect} = \frac{SS_{\text{effect}}}{SS_{\text{effect}} + SS_{\text{residual}}}$$

Partial $\eta^2$ is sometimes described as the expected effect size in a study in which the effect in question is the only effect present.

---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '') # print NA's as blank

eta.tab = as.data.frame(lsr::etaSquared(fit))
aov.fit = anova(fit)
eta.tab$source = rownames(eta.tab)
eta.tab[4, "source"] = "Residuals"
eta.tab$SS = aov.fit$`Sum Sq`
eta.tab[5, "source"] = "Total"
eta.tab[5, "SS"] = sum(eta.tab$SS)
eta.tab[,c("source", "SS", "eta.sq", "eta.sq.part")] %>%
  kable(., digits = 2,  format = "html",
        col.names = c("Source", "SS", "$\\eta^2$", '$\\text{partial }\\eta^2$'), 
         row.names = F, escape = F) %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "10em")
```

Partial $\eta^2$ will be larger than $\eta^2$ if the ignored effects account for any variability.

The sum of partial $\eta^2$ does not have a meaningful interpretation.

---

### Precision

In a factorial design, marginal means or cell means must be calculated in order to interpret main effects and the interaction, respectively. The confidence intervals around those means likewise are needed.

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
mean.summary = Data %>%
  group_by(Noise, Speed) %>%
  summarize(Time = mean(Time)) %>%
  spread("Speed", "Time")
mean.summary$Noise = as.character(mean.summary$Noise)
mean.summary$Marginal = rowMeans(mean.summary[2:4])
mean.summary[4,1] = "Marginal"
mean.summary[4,2:5] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% kable_styling() %>% group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3)
```

These means will be based on different sample sizes, which has an impact on the width of the confidence interval.

If the homogeneity of variances assumption holds, a common estimate of score variability $(MS_{residual})$ underlies all of the confidence intervals. 
---

### Precision

$$\large SE_{mean} = \sqrt{\frac{MS_{residual}}{N}}$$

$$\large CI_{mean} = Mean \pm t_{df_{residual}, \alpha = .05}\sqrt{\frac{MS_{residual}}{N}}$$

The sample size, $N$, depends on how many cases are aggregated to create the mean.

The $MS_{residual}$ is common to all calculations if homogeneity of variances is met.  The degrees of freedom for $MS_{residual}$ determine the value of $t$ to use.
