  * edit -- choppy and unstructured

1-lab.html

  * maybe add missingness (but included in class already) -- minihack?
  
3-regression.html

  * add notes to slide 18
  * add the squares
  * move regression to the mean here

  * it was particularly helpful to draw out the matrices on the board during the matrix algebra section (i.e. draw the Y vector and the X matrix with column of 1â€™s) and to keep track of matrix dimensions, etc. while explaining the B vector.

  * when to use each: only care about X and Y and controlling for variable; comparions between diff x's and incremental validity; network analysis
  
9-m_regression.html

  * better clarification for adding multiple predictors
  * add slides to walk through predicting Y from dummy codes
  * how was wisdom measured in the psych science article?
  * if time, show how factor variable is doing the same as dummy codes (how?)
  
10-m_regression.html

  * demonstrate that degrees of freedom are the same (ANOVA table and F-test of omnibus)
  * Make F-distribution plot number-free (don't give numbers that don't correspond to example)
  * reiterate example before diving back into R code
  * remind students to do reading?
