lectures overall
* add 60 second break in the middle 

course website:
* include in required materials: LaTex
* Add link to this: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/raos_tips.pdf

labs overall
* show only broom and kable for creating table summaries throughout
* in lab 9, show them papaja in depth (add links to other options, like stargazer, apaTables, and sjPlot to just create tables in Word)
* incorporate in-text R code to summarize results throughout 

final-project.html

1-correlation.html
- use t or z for statistical test?
- useful to read (skim) chapter before (send email week before)

2-correlation.html

- move scatterplots to before correlation matrices
- add slides about MAR/MCAR/MNAR 

1-lab.html

  * maybe add missingness (but included in class already) -- minihack?
  * change Dawtry example to something else
  
3-regression.html
  
  * go back and add i's 
  * double check z for standardized regression equation
  * remove sxy etc from slide 19
  * positive feedback on discussion of eugenics

4-regression.html
  
  * check z's for standardized regression equation
  * add the squares
  * add this! https://joshualoftus.com/post/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs/ 
  
2-lab.html

  * more interactive labs are good! This one is already interactive, so good template for future labs.

5-regression.html

  * move gganimate from lab 3 to here 

6-glm.html

  * possible terms to use for model comparison 
    * compact model (simpler)
    * augmented model (more complex, wanted to test)
    * proportional reduction in R^2
  * why is GLM taught before ANOVA?
  
3-lab.html

  * labs feeling repetitive
    * could this be a pandemic-specific thing?
    * options
      * move papaja lab here?
      * more applied lab? 
        * here's a question -- how would you test it?
    

7-partial.html

  * arrow from parent ses to peer relations
  * when to use each: only care about X and Y and controlling for variable; comparions between diff x's and incremental validity; network analysis
  
8-m_regression.html
  
  * remove ID variable from dataset
  * no matter where you cut the plane, the angle is the same
  * walk through GIF -- break this up into steps and different slides. May require building my own figures
  
lab-4.html

  
9-m_regression.html

  * better clarification for adding multiple predictors
  * add slides to walk through predicting Y from dummy codes
  * how was wisdom measured in the psych science article?
  * if time, show how factor variable is doing the same as dummy codes (how?)
  
10-m_regression.html

  * demonstrate that degrees of freedom are the same (ANOVA table and F-test of omnibus)
  * Make F-distribution plot number-free (don't give numbers that don't correspond to example)
  * reiterate example before diving back into R code
  * remind students to do reading?
  
11-diagnostics.html
* add something about weighted least squares (homoscedasticity)

homework-1.html
* there's an updated homework in the private repo. Use that!

Question 10.1
* last bullet point should not say "#5 and #6" but should refer to specific models. Suggestions have been made in Markdown files. 

13-dag.html
* add something before about dag models are pre-data collection tools
* add paper by Grosz, Rohrer, & Thoemmes (2020) "The taboo against explicit causal inference in non experimental psychology." As optional reading. Describe during class? 
* include covariates that reduce noise (two different things that should be included in models: confounds and noise)

homework-2.html
* make due last week of class
* weights are 1/predicted values, not predicted values!!!

lab-8.html
* change eemmeans() to lsmeans()
* use pairs() instead of contrast()
* need to specify contrasts before running the model `options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))` in order for the apaTables apa.aov.table() function to be correct
* download papaja before lab 9 (this often has errors!!!! do this soon so we can skip troubleshooting in lab 9)
* laTex may need admin privleges 

17-interactions.html
* don't mention regression sums of squares
* remove "most common" sums of squares in slides
* add SPSS and SAS defaults are type III
* add to FA and Regression comparison slide: compare output
* take out sjPlot main effects

lab-9.html
* we will NOT troubleshoot installing papaja at the beginning of this lab
