saving lm() output as a list 
  * how to explore this using View()
  * specific functions for extracting information
      * coefficients(mod.1)       # coefficients
      * residuals(mod.1)          # residuals
      * fitted.values(mod.1)      # fitted values ie predicted
      * summary(mod.1)$r.squared  # R-sq for the model
      * summary(mod.1)$sigma      # se of the model
  * broom::tidy() and broom::augment()
    * reason for using these is that extracting information from lm() output is messy -- list form, missingness problems
    
APA worthy tables
  * stargazer::stargazer()
    * can you make this work with an HTML RMarkdown?
    * using `out = file.html` argument to save to external file (show them how to open with Word)
  * sjPlot::tab_model()
    * using argument `file = file.doc` argument to save to external file
    * this one doesn't work with Rmarkdown (that saves using pandoc, which is what's used to create HTML and Word files)

APA graphics
  *sjPlot::plot_model()
    * for now, don't worry about different types of plots
      * in fact, most arguments don't work right for univariate regression
    * show.data = T
  * ggpubr::ggscatter()
    * add stat_cor() so they can add the text of the correlation to it

* confint()
* predict() -- within and out-of sample


one-way ANOVA

* setting dummy codes with constrasts(outcome) = contr.treatment(1) #replace 1 with whatever level you want to be the reference
    * also setting effects coding with contr.sum(3) #3 being the reference group
    
Lab 7: Interactions

-interaction with continuous predictors 
-simple slopes ("by hand" with +/- 1 SD)
-reghelper::simple_slopes()
-plotting interactions with sjPlot 

Lab 8: Papaja


Lab 9: Factorial ANOVA
-polynomial?

Lab 10: Bootstrapping

-use when you can't assume estimate is normally distribution; e.g. correlations 
-use when comparing very small or unequal samples 
-use when you want to get precision around some estimate that doens't come with it's own standard error (e.g. R^2, Cronbach's alpha)
